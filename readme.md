#AR Hunt

The idea was inspired from simple game 'Treasure Hunt' that is conducted in most of the events of colleges and corporate offices. 
This 'Treasure Hunt' idea was taken and little modernized during our initial stages of our college days and made 'QR Hunt', where we go in search of QR codes to get clues.
After seeing people participating actively and showing more interest in QR Hunt than they what was observed in Treasure.
So, we wanted make this game more fun, interactive and immersive for the player.
That's where the idea of 'AR Hunt' was born. The theme to search for something based on the clues remain same.
But, the way the game runs is different. This includes understanding clues, interacting with in-game characters to get clues and searching for the next checkpoints based on clues in the realworld.

Future Scope:
We want to use this as a framework and provide it to anyone who wants to conduct this type of games. 
Our idea for framework is that a person using this project should just focus on configurations, rather than coding.
